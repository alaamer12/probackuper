# About
this project aims to get all the text resources we have made and put them through a new directory and then pushing it to github. We are using the `git` command to do this.

we can also provide an option to generate a zip file of the resources.

i think we have hardly two commands [backup, update] 

backup command can be partial where to backup target partition

update command can be partial where to update target partition
